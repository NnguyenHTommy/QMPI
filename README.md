# QMPI
QMPI Project to build a quantum message passing interface with PNNL. Based on work here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01109. Developed point to point and collective communication operations on qubits for a distributed quantum network. Tested with QPE and trotterization of the transverse ising model on IBM's 5 qubit machines.
